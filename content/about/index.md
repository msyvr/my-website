Trained as a physicist and engineer, I now enjoy tackling software engineering challenges. Lately, I've been digging into the foundations of machine learning models, and techniques for their interpretation and evaluation - specifically, focusing on [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) and [mechanistic interpretability](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.14082v1).

My career has spanned research, entrepreneurship, running brick and mortar businesses, and leading teams and technical projects at both startups and small-ish orgs embedded in large institutions.

Over the years, I've called Toronto, Ann Arbor, Paris, Vancouver, Amsterdam, and Oxford home. I love the outdoors and am privileged to now have the flexibility to spend most of my time in places with exceptionally stunning nature nearby.
