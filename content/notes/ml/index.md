## Techniques
### Transformers
[The Illustrated Transformer – Jay Alammar: Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)

### Random initialization
[Randomly Initialized One-Layer Neural Networks Make Data Linearly Separable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11716)

## Model components
### Loss functions
[Loss Functions and Metrics in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02694)
