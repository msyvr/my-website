Welcome to a new version of my site. 

This move enables me to organize my writing in one place (see [Medium and Substack Posts](https://monicaspisar.com/notes/medium-and-substack-posts/)) and lower the friction of posting small notes - primarily for myself, but some may be useful for others. In the spirit of being a [Recurser](https://recurse.com), here's my small contribution to learning generously.

_Notes with a * prefix = resource collection (may/may not include any notes)_
