### "The retreat where curious programmers recharge and grow"

I first joined the [Recurse](https://recurse.com) community in the fall of 2021, then returned for a second batch in the summer of 2024. 

Recurse brands itself as the equivalent of a writers' retreat - but for software engineers. Recursers work at the edge of their abilities to become dramatically better programmers during their batch, then never-graduate and join the 2000+ alumni community.

What do Recurses do during their batches? Well, anything they want, really - unschooling at its finest. The only requirements are to live by the light-weight [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules), to commit to becoming a dramatically better programmer in-batch, and to learn generously.

### But what *is* the secret of Recuse?

The community can be humbling - it is no exaggeration to say it's brimming with technical genius. Simultaneously, generosity and kindness are foundational values. The combination is almost indescribable. 

How does Recurse do it? The [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual?_gl=1*191m3io*_ga*MTYyNTY5NzI5MS4xNzE5MzM0MjYz*_ga_VGMRYDBB5R*MTcyMTc1ODA4Ny4xLjEuMTcyMTc1ODc0Ni4wLjAuMA..#sub-sec-social-rules) aren't burdensome, yet somehow succeed at ensuring that not only do Recursers have a sense of belonging and welcome, but also of responsibility to contribute maximally. 

I've studied and worked in excellent environments, but this is on another level: the extent to which joining the Recurse community enables accelerated technical progress probably needs to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Do I know the secret? Honestly, I _could_ guess, but how could I be certain? Let's call it serendipity, magic, whatever! If you're a curious and kind programmer, and if this sounds like it might be for you, consider [applying](https://www.recurse.com/apply)!
