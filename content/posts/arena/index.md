#### &#127793; draft &#127793;

During my second batch at [RC](https://recurse.com), I joined a study group to cover the materials from [Callum McDougall's](https://www.perfectlynormal.co.uk/) Alignment Research Engineer Accelerator aka [ARENA](https://arena.education) program which is normally delivered by [LISI: the London Initiative for Safe AI](https://www.safeai.org.uk/). 

Notes in the works!
