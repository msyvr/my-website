There's a little side story here about working in Europe vs the US: Paris shuts down for 6 weeks or so in the summer, and my microfluidics contacts in Paris were basically on holiday when we were ready with model specs. I reached out to [Shu Takayama](https://microfluidics.gatech.edu/), whose lab had been adjacent to mine in GG Brown at UMich (before BUL moved to Gerstacker), and our microfluidic substrates arrived from Ann Arbor in less than a week. Work-life balance is taken very seriously by the French, and I respect that! Still, it was nice to have options when my contract was drawing to an end and I wanted to ensure the work could continue after I returned to North America.
